## Health Insurance

### Q6: What health insurance plans does Manulife offer?
**A:** Manulife offers three health plan options:
1. **Basic Plan**: Lower premium, higher deductible ($1,500 individual/$3,000 family)
2. **Standard Plan**: Moderate premium and deductible ($750 individual/$1,500 family)
