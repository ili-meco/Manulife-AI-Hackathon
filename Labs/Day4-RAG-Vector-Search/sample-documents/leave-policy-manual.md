## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Can I take vacation before it's fully accrued?
**A:** Yes, with manager approval, you may take vacation days before they are fully accrued, up to your annual entitlement. If you leave the company before accruing the taken days, the equivalent amount may be deducted from your final paycheck.

### Q2: How do I extend my parental leave beyond the standard policy?
**A:** You may request an extension of parental leave as unpaid leave of absence. Submit a written request to your manager and HR at least 4 weeks before your scheduled return date. Approval will be based on business needs and staffing considerations.

### Q3: What happens to my benefits during an unpaid leave of absence?
**A:** During unpaid leave, you may continue your benefits coverage by paying both the employee and employer portions of the premiums. If you choose not to maintain benefits, coverage will end on the last day of the month in which your paid leave ends, and you may re-enroll upon return in accordance with the benefits plan policies.
