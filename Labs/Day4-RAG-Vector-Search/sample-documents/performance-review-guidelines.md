# Performance Review Guidelines

## Introduction

This document outlines Manulife's performance review process, designed to foster employee growth, recognize achievements, and align individual goals with company objectives. These guidelines ensure a fair, consistent, and constructive performance evaluation process across the organization.

## Performance Review Cycle

### Annual Review Schedule
- **Goal Setting**: January 1-15
- **Mid-Year Check-in**: June 1-15
- **Year-End Review**: December 1-15
- **Calibration Meetings**: December 16-31
- **Results Communication**: January 15-31

### Performance Ratings
Manulife uses a 5-point rating scale:
1. **Exceptional Performance (5)** - Consistently exceeds all expectations and goals
2. **Exceeds Expectations (4)** - Regularly surpasses established goals and expectations
3. **Meets Expectations (3)** - Consistently achieves all established goals and expectations
4. **Partially Meets Expectations (2)** - Meets some but not all goals and expectations
5. **Does Not Meet Expectations (1)** - Fails to meet most goals and expectations

## Performance Improvement Plans (PIP)

### When a PIP is Required
- When an employee receives a rating of "Does Not Meet Expectations" (1)
- When an employee receives two consecutive "Partially Meets Expectations" (2) ratings
- When significant performance concerns arise between review cycles

### PIP Process
1. **Identification**: Manager identifies specific performance gaps
2. **Documentation**: HR and manager document concerns with specific examples
3. **Plan Development**: 30/60/90-day plan with clear, measurable objectives
4. **Regular Check-ins**: Weekly meetings to review progress
5. **Final Assessment**: Evaluation at the end of the PIP period

### PIP Outcomes
- **Successful Completion**: Return to regular performance management cycle
- **Extended PIP**: Additional time (typically 30-60 days) when partial improvement is shown
- **Termination**: If insufficient improvement is demonstrated

## Goal Setting Guidelines

### SMART Goals Framework

## Conducting Effective Performance Reviews

### Preparation
- **Review Documentation**: Gather project outcomes, achievements, peer feedback
- **Self-Assessment**: Request employee self-evaluation at least 1 week in advance
- **Performance Data**: Compile relevant metrics and KPIs
- **Development Notes**: Review career aspirations and growth opportunities

### During the Review Meeting
- **Start Positive**: Begin with accomplishments and strengths
- **Balanced Feedback**: Cover both achievements and areas for improvement
- **Forward-Looking**: Focus on development and future goals
- **Two-Way Dialogue**: Ensure employee has time to share perspectives
- **Clear Expectations**: Define success criteria for upcoming period

### After the Review
- **Document Discussion**: Summarize key points in writing
- **Development Plan**: Create action plan for identified growth areas
- **Follow-up Schedule**: Set regular check-in dates
- **Resources Allocation**: Identify training or support needed

## Remote Performance Reviews

### Best Practices for Virtual Reviews
- Schedule video calls for all performance discussions
- Ensure technical setup in advance
- Allow additional time for connection challenges
- Share documents in advance for reference
- Maintain same level of formality as in-person reviews

## Legal and Compliance Considerations

### Documentation Requirements
- All formal reviews must be documented in the HR system
- Records must include:
  - Performance rating justification
  - Goal achievement metrics
  - Development areas
  - Employee acknowledgment
- Documents must be retained for 7 years

### Non-Discrimination Compliance
- Reviews must focus solely on job performance
- Use objective language and specific examples
- Apply consistent standards across similar roles
- Avoid references to protected characteristics
- Maintain confidentiality of all review discussions

## Special Circumstances

### New Hire Reviews
- 30/60/90-day reviews for all new employees
- Adjusted goals for partial year employment
- Pro-rated bonus eligibility based on time in role

### Role Changes Mid-Year
- Split reviews between managers if reporting line changes
- Goal adjustment for new responsibilities
- Combined performance assessment for final rating

## Appeals Process

### Disputing a Performance Review
1. Employee submits written appeal to HR within 10 business days
2. HR schedules mediation meeting with employee and manager
3. Senior leadership review if no resolution achieved
4. Final decision communicated within 30 days
5. Decision and process documented in personnel file

## Frequently Asked Questions

- 10-15% in Partially Meets Expectations (2)
- 1-5% in Does Not Meet Expectations (1)

### Q2: How do performance ratings affect compensation?
**A:** Performance ratings directly impact annual merit increases and bonus calculations according to the following guidelines:
- Exceptional Performance (5): 4-6% increase + 100-120% bonus target
- Exceeds Expectations (4): 3-4% increase + 90-100% bonus target
- Meets Expectations (3): 2-3% increase + 80-90% bonus target
