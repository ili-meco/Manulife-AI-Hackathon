Vacation leave is accrued based on years of service (15-30 days annually), must be scheduled in advance (typically 2 weeks' notice for periods exceeding 3 days), can be carried over (up to 10 days annually), and is paid out upon termination. Personal days are fixed (3 days per year), can be taken with minimal notice for urgent personal matters, cannot be carried over to the next year, and are not paid out when employment ends. Vacation is intended for planned rest and relaxation, while personal days are designed for unexpected events or obligations that require attention during work hours.",

If you do wish to proceed with resignation, I should mention that our standard notice period is two weeks, though this may vary based on your position and contract terms.

Most Manulife travel policies include emergency medical coverage (hospital stays, doctor visits, prescriptions), medical evacuation if necessary, and 24/7 emergency assistance services. Coverage limits, exclusions, and deductibles vary by policy. Important considerations for Thailand: 1) Check if your policy has specific exclusions for activities like motorcycle riding or adventure sports, 2) Verify coverage duration matches your trip length, 3) Review coverage for tropical diseases, 4) Note any pre-existing condition limitations. Before traveling, download our Manulife TravelAid mobile app for emergency contact information and travel advisories.

Here's a comparison: TFSAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals without tax consequences, contribution room restored after withdrawals, and no mandatory withdrawals in retirement. They're often better for short-term goals or if you expect higher retirement income. RRSPs offer tax deductions for contributions, tax-deferred growth, potential tax savings if you're in a lower tax bracket at retirement, and work well for long-term retirement planning or if you're currently in a high tax bracket. Your optimal choice depends on factors like your current/expected future income, investment timeline, and financial goals. While I can provide this general information, I recommend consulting with a Manulife financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your complete financial situation.

Manulife typically allows reinstatement within 2 years of lapse, though the process becomes more complex after longer periods. To reinstate your policy, you'll need to: 1) Submit a reinstatement application, 2) Pay all missed premiums plus applicable interest, 3) Potentially provide a declaration of good health or undergo medical underwriting depending on how long the policy has been lapsed and the coverage amount. Since your policy lapsed recently, the process should be relatively straightforward.

Many people with well-managed diabetes qualify for coverage, though it may affect your premium rates or policy terms. Our underwriting process will consider several factors: 1) How well your diabetes is controlled (A1C levels), 2) Treatment compliance and management, 3) Duration since diagnosis, 4) Presence of any complications, 5) Other health factors and lifestyle considerations. Manulife offers several options that might be suitable: standard policies with adjusted premiums, simplified issue policies with fewer medical requirements, or guaranteed issue policies for those who may not qualify for traditional coverage. For the most accurate assessment, I recommend applying for coverage and going through the underwriting process or speaking with a Manulife advisor who specializes in coverage for clients with health considerations.

For life insurance: Most permanent policies remain in force with the same terms, but premium payment methods may need updating with US banking information. For health and disability insurance: Canadian policies typically don't provide coverage while residing outside Canada, so you may need to explore termination options or conversion to a US-based policy. For investments: Regulatory restrictions may limit transactions or require special reporting; non-registered accounts may face different tax treatment. RRSP/TFSA accounts can remain open but with contribution restrictions. Important actions before moving: 1) Notify Manulife of your address change and US residency status, 2) Update beneficiary designations if needed, 3) Establish a method for premium payments from a US account, 4) Consult with both Canadian and US tax advisors about cross-border implications.
