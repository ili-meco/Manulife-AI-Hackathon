      "input": "What's the difference between term and whole life insurance?",
      "expectedOutput": "Term life insurance provides coverage for a specific period (typically 10, 20, or 30 years) with lower premiums but no cash value. It's good for temporary needs like income replacement during working years or mortgage protection. Whole life insurance provides permanent coverage for your entire life with higher premiums but includes a cash value component that grows over time. It's useful for estate planning, wealth transfer, and leaving a legacy. The key differences are duration (temporary vs. permanent), premiums (lower vs. higher), cash value (none vs. accumulates), and flexibility (expires vs. lifelong coverage).",

Sometimes there might be alternatives that could address your concerns while maintaining your coverage. If you do wish to proceed with cancellation, I should mention that it might affect your future insurability and you'll lose the coverage benefits. To process the cancellation, you'll need to contact our customer service team at 1-888-MANULIFE or visit your online account portal.

Most plans include coverage for psychological services (therapists, counselors, psychologists), psychiatrist visits (covered by provincial health but extended benefits may apply), and sometimes Employee Assistance Programs offering short-term counseling. Coverage limits usually apply, such as annual maximums or per-visit caps. To check your specific coverage, please review your benefits booklet, log in to your Manulife account portal, or contact our customer service with your policy number.

All investments carry risk, including the possible loss of principal. Equity funds specifically are subject to market volatility and economic factors that can affect performance. While historical data may show long-term growth trends, past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

To maintain your coverage, please make the payment as soon as possible within this grace period. You can pay through our website, mobile app, by phone at 1-888-MANULIFE, or by setting up automatic payments to avoid future missed payments.

Here are some considerations: 1) Health Insurance: Add your child to your health benefits plan within 30 days of birth to ensure coverage from birth date, 2) Life Insurance: Consider increasing coverage to protect your family's financial future or adding a child rider to your existing policy, 3) Disability Insurance: Review if your income protection is sufficient with new financial responsibilities, 4) Education Savings: Consider setting up a Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) with government grant benefits, 5) Estate Planning: Update your will and beneficiary designations.

Most Manulife travel policies include emergency medical coverage (hospital stays, doctor visits, prescriptions), medical evacuation if necessary, and 24/7 emergency assistance services. Coverage limits, exclusions, and deductibles vary by policy. Important considerations for Thailand: 1) Check if your policy has specific exclusions for activities like motorcycle riding or adventure sports, 2) Verify coverage duration matches your trip length, 3) Review coverage for tropical diseases, 4) Note any pre-existing condition limitations. Before traveling, download our Manulife TravelAid mobile app for emergency contact information and travel advisories.

Here's a comparison: TFSAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals without tax consequences, contribution room restored after withdrawals, and no mandatory withdrawals in retirement. They're often better for short-term goals or if you expect higher retirement income. RRSPs offer tax deductions for contributions, tax-deferred growth, potential tax savings if you're in a lower tax bracket at retirement, and work well for long-term retirement planning or if you're currently in a high tax bracket. Your optimal choice depends on factors like your current/expected future income, investment timeline, and financial goals. While I can provide this general information, I recommend consulting with a Manulife financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your complete financial situation.

Manulife typically allows reinstatement within 2 years of lapse, though the process becomes more complex after longer periods. To reinstate your policy, you'll need to: 1) Submit a reinstatement application, 2) Pay all missed premiums plus applicable interest, 3) Potentially provide a declaration of good health or undergo medical underwriting depending on how long the policy has been lapsed and the coverage amount. Since your policy lapsed recently, the process should be relatively straightforward.

      "expectedOutput": "Having type 2 diabetes doesn't automatically prevent you from getting life insurance with Manulife. Many people with well-managed diabetes qualify for coverage, though it may affect your premium rates or policy terms. Our underwriting process will consider several factors: 1) How well your diabetes is controlled (A1C levels), 2) Treatment compliance and management, 3) Duration since diagnosis, 4) Presence of any complications, 5) Other health factors and lifestyle considerations. Manulife offers several options that might be suitable: standard policies with adjusted premiums, simplified issue policies with fewer medical requirements, or guaranteed issue policies for those who may not qualify for traditional coverage. For the most accurate assessment, I recommend applying for coverage and going through the underwriting process or speaking with a Manulife advisor who specializes in coverage for clients with health considerations.

For life insurance: Most permanent policies remain in force with the same terms, but premium payment methods may need updating with US banking information. For health and disability insurance: Canadian policies typically don't provide coverage while residing outside Canada, so you may need to explore termination options or conversion to a US-based policy. For investments: Regulatory restrictions may limit transactions or require special reporting; non-registered accounts may face different tax treatment. RRSP/TFSA accounts can remain open but with contribution restrictions. Important actions before moving: 1) Notify Manulife of your address change and US residency status, 2) Update beneficiary designations if needed, 3) Establish a method for premium payments from a US account, 4) Consult with both Canadian and US tax advisors about cross-border implications. Please contact our Cross-Border Services team at 1-888-MANULIFE (ext. 5463) for personalized guidance on your specific policies.",
